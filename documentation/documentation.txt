Explication of the work invlolved in planning and developing the Site:
  
  Understanding the requirements:
    The first step was understand what the requirements are for a restaurant website. We decided to stay true to the client's needs pertaining to the main features. This included making sure that we were implementing the core features of a restaurant website which the client would deem the most important such as a menu, reservation system, contact information, and location details.
  
  Planning: 
    The next step was planning. We we set all our ideas onto paper, using a diagram software to create a flow diagram of how pages would interact with each other using a navigation system we would create. We also decided on the separation of tasks, with those having more experience taking on the tougher tasks. (see Basic_diagram png image in documentation folder)

  Design: 
    The third step was coming to an agreement on design. We decided to target a high-end restaurant clientelle. This is reflected by our minimalistic design as well as our color pallete which includes a dark charcoal background with golden highlights.

  Developpement:
    With the planning done, we got to work. Using a page template, we each developped our own pages with their unique features. We decided to take some creative liberties with the website, allowing for individual talent to shine. This included integrating google maps onto the contacts page and a fully functional form with calendar and time selection.
