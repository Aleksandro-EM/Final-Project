Detailed explanation of the subject selected:

  The subject we decided to select for this project was a high-end restaurant website. We thought this would require a broad range of techniques and subjects not necessarily covered in our class and would provide good experience for future projects. 
  
Overall goal and purpose of the web site:
  
  The overall goal of the website was to provide a business solution for restaurant owners that fit all of their needs such as a reservation system, a menu page and a contacts & directions page. We wanted to do this in the most minimalistic way possible to avoid clutter and overstimulation, which could lead potential customers away from the website.

Explication of the work invlolved in planning and developing the Site:
  
  Understanding the requirements:
    The first step was understand what the requirements are for a restaurant website. We decided to stay true to the client's needs pertaining to the main features. This included making sure that we were implementing the core features of a restaurant website which the client would deem the most important such as a menu, reservation system, contact information, and location details.
  
  Planning: 
    The next step was planning. We we set all our ideas onto paper, using a diagram software to create a flow diagram of how pages would interact with each other using a navigation system we would create. We also decided on the separation of tasks, with those having more experience taking on the tougher tasks. (see Basic_diagram png image in documentation folder)

  Design: 
    The third step was coming to an agreement on design. We decided to target a high-end restaurant clientelle. This is reflected by our minimalistic design as well as our color pallete which includes a dark charcoal background with golden highlights.

  Developpement:
    With the planning done, we got to work. Using a general page template one of us created, we each developped our own pages with their unique features. We decided to take some creative liberties with the website, allowing for individual talent to shine. This included integrating google maps onto the contacts page and a fully functional form with calendar and time selection.

  Final review:
    When all of our pages were completed, we reviewed the entirety of the website to ensure that all functionality was ready for showcase. We made sure to check the validity of our code with the W3C veification tool to ensure proper coding practices were implemented.


Planning steps performed:
  
  1. Finding subject : We collaborated to find a suitable project topic that would enable us to showcase our skills while delivering a quality website. 
  2. Research: We took inspiration from other websites to identify what the most important pieces of the website were in order to impliment similar ideas.
  3. Layout: Using a whiteboard tool (excalidraw), we created a sketch to agree on how pages would interact with eachother, and acting as a sort of sitemap. See image in documentation folder


Individual Team Assignments:

  - Separation of tasks:
    - Aleks will do the Reservation Page and form confirmation page.
    - Valére will do the Menu Page.
    - Belinda will do the Contact & Directions page.
    - Everyone (or whoever has the bandwith) will work on the homepage.


Problems that arose during the development of the website:
  
  One of the biggest challenges we faced during the developpement of the website was Git. With most of us using this tool for the first time, and some of us having only used the tool in a solo-setting, we faced some difficulties with getting everyone setup and on the same page regarding commits, merges and Pull requests. We took some time in our scrum meeting where we leveraged the git documentation as well as previous class notes to remedy the situation. This not only helped those who had issues, but it also served as a refresher for those who were familiar with the tool, but lacked the knowledge to properly troubleshoot the git issues the team was facing.
